Make GitHub desktop version adaptable for smaller screens.

• The user.js file works with the Greasemonkey Firefox extension; 
• the .css file works with the Stylish extension both in Firefox and Firefox for Android.

The files are meant to make the GitHub desktop version adaptable for smaller screens and smaller viewport widths, because I don't deem the mobile version of the site to be as usable.

I have not decided on a license yet.

GitHub and other trade and service marks are the property of their respective owners.
