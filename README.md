Make GitHub desktop version adaptable for smaller screens.

• The user.js file works with the Greasemonkey Firefox extension;

• the .css file works with the Stylish extension both in Firefox and Firefox for Android.

The files are meant to make the GitHub desktop version adaptable for smaller screens and smaller viewport widths, because I don't deem the mobile version of the site to be as usable.

Two use cases:

1. I prefer visiting the GitHub desktop site directly to access a userstyle for installation on Firefox for Android.

   1.1 Trouble is, that the Stylish extension in Firefox for Android is unable to tell, if a .css file hosted on GitHub is a newer version. At some point, I manually revisited a .css file via GitHub in Firefox for Android to locally update a particular userstyle, until I learned to copy-paste the file location from the Stylish extension.
   
   1.2 But no matter - because first-time manual userstyle addition through an adaptable GitHub web design should still be facilitated, and this is what these userstyles provide.
   
   1.3 The design, therefore, allows general access to all other files (per appropriate permissions set by project owners), including editing and saving commits.
   
2. Accessing GitHub and editing source code in a narrower window (to have another window side-by-side, but also actually accommodating smaller screen resolutions).

I have not gone over all site design details, save the ones that I found useful. GitHub site design and its corresponding CSS is generally clean, and gets points for being unobdure.

I have not decided on a license yet.

GitHub and other trade and service marks are the property of their respective owners.
