Make GitHub desktop version adaptable for smaller screens.

• The user.js file works with the Greasemonkey Firefox extension;

• the .css file works with the Stylish extension both in Firefox and Firefox for Android.

The files are meant to make the GitHub desktop version adaptable for smaller screens and smaller viewport widths, because I don't deem the mobile version of the site to be as usable.

Two use cases:

1. I prefer visiting the GitHub desktop site directly to access a userstyle for installation on Firefox for Android.

   1.1 Trouble is, that the Stylish extension in Firefox for Android is unable to tell, if a .css file hosted on GitHub is a newer version; so in Firefox for Android, I often manually revisit the file to locally update a particular userstyle.

2. Accessing GitHub and editing source code in a narrower window (to have another window side-by-side, but also actually accommodating smaller screen resolutions).

I have not decided on a license yet.

GitHub and other trade and service marks are the property of their respective owners.
